Adversarial AI Stress-Testing Portfolio

By Dominik — Red-Team Logic & Behavioral Analysis

I specialize in breaking AI models cleanly and intelligently:

exposing inconsistencies

pressure-testing boundaries

mapping behavioral drift

detecting alignment failures

building adversarial prompts that reveal weak points

analyzing contradiction patterns across sessions

My goal is simple: stress the system until the truth shows.

Methodology
1. Inconsistency Detection

I run repeated variations of the same question to expose drift, contradiction, or unstable reasoning patterns.

2. Pressure Testing

I apply emotional tone, time pressure, confidence challenges, or logic traps to see how a model stabilizes or collapses.

3. Boundary Mapping

I test how clearly the model defines:

safety limits

system constraints

logic boundaries

refusal consistency

4. Pattern Drift Analysis

I observe how models change across long conversations, updates, or user-profile expectations.

5. Clean Break Attacks

Prompts designed to reveal brittle rules, shallow alignment, or inconsistent principles — without jailbreaks.

Why This Portfolio Exists

LLMs don’t fail violently — they fail quietly.
My work is about finding the quiet failures before they become loud ones.

This repository shows examples of:

adversarial conversations

inconsistency hunts

behavior-mapping sequences

red-team style evaluation tests

More will be added as the portfolio expands.

Open for independent evaluation work, testing contracts, and model behavior research.
